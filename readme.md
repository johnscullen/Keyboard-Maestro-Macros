## Macro Details

### Find in OmniFocus
Activates a custom perspective called *All* that displays all remaining tasks in the OmniFocus database and activates the Find field in the toolbar ready for your search. You'll need to create the custom perspective in OmniFocus. See [johnscullen.com/find-in-omnifocus](http://johnscullen.com/find-in-omnifocus) for details.

The macro can be triggered from any application and will launch OmniFocus if it's not already running.

### Show quick entry window
This avoids the problem of hitting your quick entry shortcut and nothing happening because OmniFocus isn't running. Launches OmniFocus if needed and displays the Quick Entry window to capture a new task.
